Updates:

24-5-2022
- Automatically makes folders to store matches
- Fixed bug in date matching
- Fixed bug in exporting WITHIN series
- Fixed bug in CLEANING of eigenaren
- Added adaptive matching indicators for moeder and eigenaar
- Added flags for month + day to WITHIN
- Added month + day to matching score in WITHIN
- 2 mothers without a name now also receive a match score of 2.5, as it is unlikely that mothers are only named in 1 entry
- addendums to names can now receive a -1 if they don't overlap, 0 for twice nothing, and +1 for identical addendums
- Previous and next enslaved are now also scored in WITHIN for group transfers
- BETWEEN now matches end/begin combinations or events that occured in overlapping years (1838, 1848, 1851-3), rather than all entries. As a result,
	- We now only check the previous entry - rather than the previous next entry - for the last-listed entry on a folio
	- Only look for duplicates that occured in in overlapping years (1 year in series 1-2, 2-3), (3 years in series 3-4).
